## **C# Web Browser**
This repository is a web browser, fully coded in **C#** and **Windows Forms** (old style, I know).
The repository is in active development, with code updates and releases at least once per week.

## **Core project**
The core project has 3 aims.
*1* Ease of use
*2* Accessibility
*3* Connectivity

**Ease of use**
The web browser is intended to be used to help those who may have difficulty using other web browser, e.g firefox. chrome. It has a large UI for those with vision problems, and quick buttons to websites they might want to use.

**Accessibility**
As mentioned before, the web browser is intended to be used to help those who might need some help getting online. There is still a search bar, so they can go to websites not in the buttons. We want everyone to have access to the internet, and that is why we made this project.

**Connectivity**
Connectivity might bring multiple things to mind. For example, getting online, or getting the help needed to get online. Because our browser is very minimalistic, it is ideal for those with slower internet connections. It is also a good started browser for those who have never actually used the internet.

## **How to download**
This project has a few ways you can download and run it. You can click [here](https://github.com/ttvfimin/C-Web-Browser/releases) (releases) and download just the program. If you wanted something more advanced, or you wanted to check out the source code, you can go above and go through. (Please note, this program was coded in VS 2015).

## **The cookbook**
Yes, you read that right. Right now, this project is a single code, however we are hoping to expand the program to an API, where you can easily add everything into one.
